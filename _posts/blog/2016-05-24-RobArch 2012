The architectural interest in robotics was really well represented by a conference that happened in Vienna, called Rob/Arch, in 2012. Founded by Sigrid Brell-Cokcan and Johannes Braumann, the conference had as objective creating a plataform that shows the innovative uses of robotic fabrication in the creative industry, bringing together members of industry and academia, as wll as architects, artists and designers.

## Usage

To enable MathJax support be sure Kramdown is your Markdown flavor of choice and MathJax is set to true in your `_config.yml` file.

~~~
markdown: kramdown
mathjax: true
~~~

~~~
Here is an example MathJax inline rendering \\( 1/x^{2} \\), and here is a block rendering: 
\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]
~~~

Here is an example MathJax inline rendering \\( 1/x^{2} \\), and here is a block rendering: 
\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]

The only thing to look out for is the escaping of the backslash when using markdown, so the delimiters become `\\[ ... \\]` and `\\( ... \\)` for inline and block maths respectively.
