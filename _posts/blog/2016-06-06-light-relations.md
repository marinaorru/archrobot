With the research focused on building a system for light control that works automatically according to the exterior space, the idea of having an artistic aspect has also developed. Knowing about different relations between interior and exterior in architecture, there is an interesting point that can be observed and studied.

How could we bring something different inside walls that we only see when outside of a building? How could it also have some artistic view? 

Through these questions and through the objective of the robot, an idea emerged when thinking about the sunset. The sunset is the daily disappearance of the Sun below the western horizon as a result of Earthâ€™s rotation. It creates unique atmospheric conditions such as the often intense orange and red colors of the Sun and the surrounding sky.

The idea now is to keep in mind the light control for the interior, but also working together at some point with representations of the sunset and sunrise colors inside a building. In that way, we could spend hours inside this place knowing how the outside is. The amount of light would be totally linked with the amount of light that is on the exterior, making the balance to economy energy. Also, during some periods of the day the light would change its colors according to the sunrise and sunset colors, making a beautiful and inspirational space indoor.
