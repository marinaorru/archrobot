The definition explains robotics as a branch of engineering that involves the conception, design, manufacture and operation of robots. This field overlaps with electronics, computer science, artificial intelligence, mechatronics, nanotechnology and bioengineering.
Isaac Asimov is known as the science-fiction author and also the first to use the term robotics in a short story in the 1940s. He suggested three principles to guide the behavior of robots and smart machines, the _Three Laws of Robotics_:

*Robots must never harm human beings
*Robots must follow instructions from humans without violating rule 1
*Robots must protect themselves without violating the other rules
